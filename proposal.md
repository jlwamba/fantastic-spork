Fantastic Spork Team Product Proposal


User's Case: 
1. We (students) want to know when/if our email is received by the professor.
2. We (professors) want to know when/if our email is received by students.

Product Description:
We want to create an app that sends user's a notifcation when their email is received, viewed, and/or intended on being responded to. As students, we want to create this to to ensure it is received by the correct contact(s), depending on the nature of the email (ex. emergency situations), and to ensure there is not a server and/or client error.

Should email encryption be a thing?
-Only those that have the private key can decrypt the email

Situation: You sent the wrong email to someone else possibly containing sensitive information. This is a very common mistake that occurs for those with simple email addresses.
